Installation
~~~~~~~~~~~~

on macOS:
-------

 #. Install `Python`_, if not installed already.
     * While macOS comes with a python 2.7 interpreter, it's old and doesn't have the `pip` module OSPREY installation requires. If you're still using Python 2, only the latest maintenance release will work.  In any case, we highly recommend installing Python3, either using homebrew or directly from the Python website.
     * Install the `64-bit` verison, not the `32-bit` version.
 #. Download the `newest Osprey Python release`_.
     * Download either `osprey-osx-python2` or `osprey-osx-python3` to match your Python version.
     * Extract the acrhive to your favorite folder.
 #. Run the ``install.sh`` script to install Osprey.::
 
     $ ./install.sh


on Windows:
-----------

Make sure you're running 64-bit Windows. Osprey is not supported on 32-bit Windows.

 #. Install `Python`_.
     * Both v2 and v3 are supported. We highly recommend Python 3. Python 3 can be installed using the scoop package manager or directly from the Python website.
     * Install the `x86-64` verison, not the `x86` version.
     * During Python installation, enable the option to ``Add python.exe to Path``.
 #. Download the `newest Osprey Python release`_.
     * Download either `osprey-win-python2` or `osprey-win-python3` to match your Python version.
     * Extract the acrhive to your favorite folder.
 #. Run the ``install`` batch script to install Osprey.


on Linux:
---------------------

*Including distributions like Ubuntu and Mint*

Make sure you're running 64-bit Linux. Osprey is not supported on 32-bit Linux.

 #. Install `Python`_.
     * For Debian-like distributions, including Ubuntu and Mint, run::

       $ sudo apt install python3 python3-pip

       or::

       $ sudo apt install python2.7 python-pip

       depending on which version of Python you want to use.

 #. Download the `newest Osprey Python release`_.
     * Download either `osprey-linux-python2` or `osprey-linux-python3` to match your Python version.
     * Extract the acrhive to your favorite folder.
 #. Run the ``install`` script to install Osprey.::

 	$ ./install.sh

To check your installation:
---------------------------

From the command line, run:

.. code:: pycon

	python3
	>>> import osprey
	>>> osprey.start()

If successful, should should be greeted with a message something like the following::

	OSPREY 3.2-beta1-dev, Python 3.6.9, Java 11.0.6, Linux-4.15.0-91-generic-x86_64-with-LinuxMint-19-tara
	Using up to 1024 MiB heap memory: 128 MiB for garbage, 896 MiB for storage


Upgrading from an older version
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you're upgrading from an older installation of Osprey, just run the install script. There's no need
to explicitly uninstall the older version.


Uninstallation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To uninstall Osprey, use the provided shell script.

on Windows::

	> uninstall.bat

on Linux or Mac::

	$ ./uninstall.sh


Running Osprey
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

using Python scripts
--------------------

Python scripting is the preferred way of using Osprey due to its simplicity and flexibilty.
To run Osprey from a Python script:

.. code:: python

	import osprey
	osprey.start()
	
	# run osprey commands, e.g.
	osprey.printGpuInfo()
	
For more information about Python scripting with Osprey, see the tutorial at ``doc/tutorial.html``
(in the downloaded zip file) or the Python documentation at ``doc/api.osprey.html``.

Many Osprey features are explained in example scripts
which can be found in the downloaded zip file at ``examples/python.*/*.py``.

A comprehensive manual for Osprey has yet to be written,
but these example scripts can help you get started with common design tasks.


using the command-line interface
--------------------------------

The Python interface to Osprey represents a significant improvement in the user interface over the
older command-line interface, and new Osprey projects should consider using the Python interface
rather than the command-line interface.

However, for backwards compatibility, the command-line interface is still provided, although
it may not receive feature updates in the future. It may eventually be removed from Osprey.

To access the command-line interface, download the Osprey Java distribution.
Extract it to your favorite folder, then enter the following command into a shell::

    $ cd bin
    $ ./osprey [commands]

where ``[commands]`` are the Osprey commands you want to run. You can run Osprey without
``[commands]`` and Osprey will print a list of the available commands.

To show the version of your Osprey installation, try::

    $ ./osprey version

To run a GMEC-based protein design, try::

    $ ./osprey FindGMEC /path/to/config1 /path/to/config2 ...

To show GPU informatino, try::

    $ ./osprey GPUInfo

The ``GpuInfo`` command prints info about available GPUs in the system, and which
ones Osprey can use.
