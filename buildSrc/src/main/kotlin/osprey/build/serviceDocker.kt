	/**
	 * Dear future me:
	 *
	 * You may be tempted to put a task in here to build docker images for Osprey.
	 *
	 * Don't do it!
	 *
	 * Due to the way docker works, the build steps must be run with sudo or you will get a "Permission denied" error.
	 * Don't put your user in the `docker` group to try to avoid the sudo requirement, it's a huge security risk, see:
	 * https://fosterelli.co/privilege-escalation-via-docker.html
	 *
	 * The only other option is then to run Gradle with root access.
	 * This is a Very Bad Idea, since Gradle routinely downloads code from the internet and immediately executes it.
	 * Especially when you're running it for the first time as the root user and Gradle has to entirely repopulate
	 * its caches for a new user. You wouldn't give the internet root access to your machine. Don't run Gradle
	 * as root unless you're in a VM or container.
	 *
	 * Don't subject your development machine to huge security risks for a tiny bit of convenience.
	 * Just run your docker build steps directly in a short shell script under sudo.
