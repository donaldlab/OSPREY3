# Before we get started:
# Preparing a molecule for Osprey can be a very error-prone process.
# Automated scripts, by their very nature, don't provide any feedback
# to the user between processing steps, so these errors are very likely
# to go unnoticed. For that reason, we strongly recommend that molecule
# preparations be done interactively using the GUI rather than an automated
# script. Nevertheless, if you already know where the errors in the prep
# process will happen, you can automate the prep using a script like this
# one, after customizing it to your specific situation.

    # Molecule Preparation Step 1: remove duplicate atoms
    # Duplicate atoms don't usually appear in files from the PDB,
    # but these errors can happen sometimes in modified PDB files.

    # Molecule Preparation Step 2: add missing heavy atoms
    # Somtimes atom positions are not well-resolved in the electron density,
    # or protein chain end-caps are missing.

    # be able to infer bonds correctly in the next step.

    # Molecule Preparation Step 4: add hydrogens
    # Most PDB files based on X-ray crystallography don't describe Hydrogen atoms,
    # usually because light atoms aren't well-resolved in the electron density.
    # Generally, automatic protonation inference works well on proteins,
    # so let's just protonate PTPase for now, we'll protonate HEPES later

    # Formal net charges are used by Amber to calculate partial charges
    # which parameterize the electrostatic components of the forcefield for small molecules.
    # Let's also add a formal net charge for HEPES, but we don't need to add one for PTPase.
    hepes.setNetCharge(osprey.jvm.boxInt(0))

    # Molecule Preparation Step 6: minimize structures
    # Osprey picks sequences by looking for low-energy conformations.
    # Let's make sure our starting structure is low-energy
    # by doing an all-atom minimization against the Amber forcefield
    # but restrain the heavy atoms so they don't move around too much
