## Downloads and Installation

### OSPREY Desktop

OSPREY Desktop is a native desktop application that allows you to pepare designs to run later
on OSPREY server. OSPREY Desktop gives you an interactive graphical interface to:
 * Import molecules from PDB files
 * Edit molecules and add missing information, if any
 * Define conformational flexibility
 * Choose mutations
 * Check for any issues before starting the lengthy design computations

Choose this download to help you prepape your designs for OSPREY Server.

### OSPREY Server

OSPREY Server is a [Python][python] library that provides scripting access to all of OSPREY's features.
OSPREY Server allows you to write Python scripts to:
 * Perform any task available in OSPREY Desktop
 * Run design algorithms on your prepared designs using the best-available computing hardware, including:
   * Multi-core CPUs
   * [CUDA][cuda]-capable GPUs
   * [SLURM][slurm]-capable compute clusters

[python]: https://www.python.org/
[cuda]: http://www.nvidia.com/cuda
[slurm]: https://slurm.schedmd.com/overview.html

Despite the name, OSPREY Server can also be used on desktop and laptop machines.
Although OSPREY is very resource-hungry and works best on powerful machines with lots of compute resources,
particularly CPUs, GPUs, and RAM.

Choose this download if you want to run OSPREY designs and are familiar with Python script programming.

### OSPREY Service

Although OSPREY is a cross-platform application, not all of the design preparation features work on all platforms.
OSPREY Service is an internet service that provides these features for platforms where they are not supported.
The Donald Lab provides a default service that OSPREY will use automatically when preparing designs, so
most people will not need to download OSPREY service. Hovewer, if you don't want to rely on the service
provided by the Donald Lab, then you can self-host your own service.

The OSPREY Service is only supported on Linux.

Choose this download to self-host your own service for OSPREY design preparation.
