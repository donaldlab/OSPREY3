## Osprey Server

### using Python scripts

To run Osprey from a Python script:

```python
import osprey
osprey.start()

# run osprey commands, e.g.
osprey.printGpuInfo()
```

For more information about Python scripting with Osprey, see the tutorial at ``doc/tutorial.html``
(in the downloaded zip file) or the Python documentation at ``doc/api.osprey.html``.

Many Osprey features are explained in example scripts
which can be found in the downloaded zip file at ``examples/python.*/*.py``.

A comprehensive manual for Osprey has yet to be written,
but these example scripts can help you get started with common design tasks.
